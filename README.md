### Methodology:
 As it is not only a face recognization app it will also give quotations which boosts our power and make us to inspire.
 Like if the recognised emotion is sad it will give quote such a way that they will be changing their mood.
 Our code works as shown below.
 First importing libraries like keras,tensorflow,OpenCv,numpy etc.
 The next is over model, which is in HDF(hierarchy Data Format)
 Then we are stating the emotions in a list like "Angry","sad","happy","Disgust","surprise","Neutral" etc....
 Next one is for opening webcam. 
 And capturing a real time image(that is we are not uploading a pre-existing one).
 #### ABOUT USED LIBRARIES:
 keras:  Keras allows us to define and train models easily, making it a popular choice for deep learning tasks.It is mainly used for training       networks. Keras is used for creating deep models that can be productized on smartphones.
 OpenCV: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a popular computer vision library that provides a wide range of functions and algorithms   for image and video processing.It provides various methods for detecting, recognizing, and analyzing faces and facial expressions in our         code.It is also used for preprocessing the image data such as inverting,resizing,cropping...etc.
 numpy: It is a fundamental library for scientific computing in python.In our project NumPy is also used for manipulating and processing the       image data as arrays.
 tensorflow: It provides various tools and functions for building, training, and deploying complex models on different platforms and devices. In   our project tensorflow is used for implementing the core algorithms and computations involved in facial emotion recognition.
 ##### KEY WORDS:
 Face detection: Detects faces in an image through web cam.
 Emotion detection: Recognizes facial expressions and emotions.
 Emotion detection from facial expressions is an active area of research in computer vision and artificial intelligence. It has a wide range of     applications, including human-computer interaction, market research, mental health analysis. 
 This project is based on python, deep learning.
 The code provided in this repository uses a pre-trained deep learning model to detect faces in images and then predicts the corresponding emotions. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled facial expressions.
 We will be seeing bounding boxes around detected faces along with the predicted emotion labels.
