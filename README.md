### Methodology:
 As it is not only a face recognization app it will also give quotations which boosts our power and make us to inspire.
 Like if the recognised emotion is sad it will give quote such a way that they will be changing their mood.
 Our code works as shown below.
 First importing libraries like keras,tensorflow,OpenCv,numpy etc.
 The next is over model, which is in HDF(hierarchy Data Format)
 Then we are stating the emotions in a list like "Angry","sad","happy" etc.
 Next one is for opening webcam 
 And capturing a real time image(that is we are not uploading a pre-existing one)
 #### ABOUT USED LIBRARIES:
 keras:  Keras allows you to define and train models easily, making it a popular choice for deep learning tasks.
